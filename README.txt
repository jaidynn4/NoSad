ALPHA RELEASE FEEDBACK
//////////////////////

1) The app's green color was too dark for text to show up properly.
	- This was addressed by choosing a lighter green for our interface.

2) Some of our buttons had not been set to match the app's green theme.
	- This was addressed by clicking through our screens and finding where something needed to be changed to match.

3) The Add Page was confusing.
	- This was addressed by renaming the page "Add Mood" and finishing the implementation of the dropdown switchers.

4) The Records screen text was cluttered and had alignment issues.
	- This was addressed by revising the layout of the screen items.

5) The Home Screen icons were in the middle of text, which was not visually appealing.
	- This was addressed by moving text to the side.

6) The Metrics slider could not slide to the right.
	- This bug was fixed.

7) The bottom bar partially covered items on certain screens.
	- This was addressed by adjusting spacing.

8) Some buttons were disabled.
	- This bug was fixed.
